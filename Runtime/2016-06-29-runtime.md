## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Squeezing in a minor release addressing some regressions (plug-ins, .cfignore pattern, loggregator panic) and allowing binding of route services to routes with paths, after which we'll continue on adding support for defining TCP routes and HTTP routes with paths in app manifests
- Completed phase 1 of improving `cf help` UX, added to the backlog after the above mentioned releases. The idea is that `cf help` output would be reduced in length by omitting admin-only and less frequently used commands, command descriptions, and the remaining commands will be listed in tabular format to take advantage of window width (like `ls`). `cf help -a` will return the current output. We'll also add a `SEE ALSO` section to the help of subcommands.

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Fixed a bug where client destroy operations could race with grace time destroy and a concurrent create, leading to two containers with the same IP address. Will ship a new release with the fix this week.

#### Garden-runC

- Lots of logging improvements
- Investigated SELinux vs. AppArmor, [details here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118632171) - TL;DR: AppArmor wins for the CF Garden use case
- Fixed disk quotas on Xenial

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished adding Postgres support to BBS
- BBS benchmarks pass at 200K instances, 1000 simulated cells against an HA CF-MySQL deployment: bulk retrievals well under 10s
- Updating performance protocol for end-to-end tests with 250K apps
- Close to declaring official support for relational stores, ending support for etcd
- Migrating Diego repos to cloudfoundry GitHub org, 'code.cloudfoundry.org' import paths
- BOSH-deployed Diego processes all run as 'vcap' user instead of root
- Cell uses post-start script to check for readiness to take on work
- Cell rep applies its rate-limiter to all downloads
- Documented instructions for deploying Diego alongside minimal CF AWS deployment
